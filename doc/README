This is the home directory of the CineFiles site application owner. It contains
7 subdirectories; the purpose of each is described below. Please adhere to
these guidelines when creating new files.

~/bin
  
  Contains executable files, or links to executable files. This directory is on 
  the application owner's PATH. If you want a file to be executable from a
  login shell without specifying a full path, put it (or a link to it) here.
  The bin directory should not contain subdirectories. A subdirectory would
  not be on the PATH, so it would defeat the purpose. If you're tempted to
  create a subdirectory, it's likely you should be putting your files in ~/opt
  or ~/src.
  
  It's like:
    /usr/bin
    /usr/local/bin

~/certs

  Contains certificates.

~/log

  Contains log files. The retention policy is TBD. For now, they may be
  considered to be persistent for a period on the order of months, but may be
  deleted or archived if disk space becomes a problem.

  It's like:
    /var/log

~/opt

  Contains software installations not managed by the package manager. Typically
  this means any software that is distributed in a zip file or tarball.
  Unzip/untar the software into this directory, or into a subdirectory you
  create. Each software package will have its own subdirectory structure. If any
  executables in the package should be invocable without specifying the full
  path, link them into ~/bin.

  It's like:
    /opt

~/src

  Contains source code, typically managed by source control, and usually by git.
  Clone the git repository into this directory, or a subdirectory you create.
  If any executables in the repository should be invocable without specifying
  the full path, link them into ~/bin.

  It's like:
    /usr/src
    
~/tmp

  Contains temporary files and directories. The retention policy is TBD. For
  now, they may be considered to be persistent for a period on the order of
  weeks, but may be deleted if disk space becomes a problem. Please delete
  files from ~/tmp as soon as you're done with them.

  It's like:
    /tmp
    
~/tomcat6-cinefiles_site

  Contains the CineFiles site tomcat installation.
